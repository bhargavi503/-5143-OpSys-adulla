## Question 1

What does it mean to preempt a process?
In the computing environment, the preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting the task that is being carried out by a computer system, without the requirement of its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time. 
Such a change is known as a context switch.Preempting a process of performing the multi tasking,
which allows the user to perform tasks from a cooperative multitasking system where the processes or tasks must be explicitly programmed to get when they do not need system resources.

## Question 2

What is swapping and what is its purpose?
We use the swapping techinque to replace pages or segments of data in memory.It enables a computer to execute programs and manipulate larger data files than main memory. 
Swapping is a memory/process management which is used by the operating system.
The utilization of the processor is increased by moving some blocked process from the main memory to the secondary memory(hard disk).
Thus it forms a queue of temporarily suspended process and continues with execution of the newly arrived process.
After the swapping process is completed,We have to Select a process for execution in the operating system and the following steps are performed. 
The Operating System admits the newly created process or 
The suspended process from the swap memory are activated by the operating system.

## Question 3

List three general categories of information in a process control block?
The process control block is also called as the data strcuture.It is used to store the information about the processes.
The three general categories of information in a process control block are
1.Process identification data
2.Processor state data
3.Process control data
Process identification data contains a specific identifier. This identifier is used to cross verify the tables to know which process uses which I/o.
Process state data defines status of process when suspended and lets it again execute correctly .
Process control state is used to manage the process itself, it contains program counters, process state and many more.

## Question 4

Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?
In a computer we have two different types of modes: user mode and kernel mode.
The processor will be switching between these two modes depending upon the type of the code it is running.
All the applications will run in user mode and the operating system components run in kernel mode.
Many of the drivers run in the kernel mode and some of the drivers run in the user mode.
To start a user-mode application,  a process is created for the application. 
The application is provided with a private virtual address space and a private handle table by the process.
When an application runs and if it gets crashed,the crash is limited to that one application. The other applications in that operating system are not affected by the crash.
kernel mode shares a single virtual address space when we run the code in it.
This means that the driver in the kernel mode is not isolated from the other drivers and the operating system itself.

## Question 5

What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?
Interrupt vs Trap 
When the normal execution of a program is performed in a computer,there may be some events which cause the temporarily halt of the CPU.These type of halts are called interrupts.
Interrupts are called as the hardware interrupts.The transfer of control is identified as a trap,which is initiated by the programmer.
Traps are the software-invoked interrupts. 
Occurrences of hardware interrupts usually disable other hardware interrupts, but this is not true for traps. 
If you need to disallow the hardware interrupts form the computer until a trap is served,you have to clear the interrupt flag explicitly. 
The interrupt flag on the computer affects the hardware interrupts mostly compared to the traps. 
This says that by clearing this flag will not prevent the traps. 
Interrupts should preserve the previous state of the CPU when compared to the traps.

## Question 6

Give three examples of an interrupt?
When we are executing a process in the computer and if the user requests for the another process, disturbance may be created for the running process.
This type of disturbances are called as the Interrupts.Interrupts are mainly generated by the user,error conditions,sofwares and hardwares.
These interrupts are handled by the CPU very carefully and the responses are generated for those interrupts by the CPU.
CPU will handle the interrupts by fetch,decode and execute operations.
The three types of interrupts are
1)Internal Interrupt:If the user is executing some operations and some instructions and if those operations are not Possible to execute but the user is trying for that Operations.
2)Software Interrupt:For Example when we are Processing Some Instructions and we want to Execute one or more Application Programs.
3)External Interrupt:For Example When we are executing a program and at the same time if we move the Mouse on the Screen,then the CPU will handle this External interrupt first and
 after that he will resume with its Operation.
 
## Question 7

What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?
When the processor switches from one thread/process to another thread/process it is called as the process switch.
When the privilege levels of the CPU changes then it is called as the mode switch.
A mode switch occurs without changing the state of the process that is currently
in the Running state. 
A process switch involves taking of the currently executing process out of the Running state in favor of another process.
